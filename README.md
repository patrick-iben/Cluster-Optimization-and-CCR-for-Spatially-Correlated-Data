# Cluster Optimization and CCR for Spatially-Correlated Data
This repository provides guidance and assessment of semi-supervised clustering techniques and covariate-constrained randomization for spatially-correlated data. This guide is written in R Markdown. For reproducibility, the output was generated via the command line in R with the render() function from the "rmarkdown" package.
